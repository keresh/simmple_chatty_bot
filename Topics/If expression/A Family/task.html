   Wow! This problem is kind of tricky. If you're ready to put your thinking cap on, brace yourself and good luck! Otherwise, you can skip it for now and return any time later

  <p>Annie has a family: mother Lucy, father James, sister Emily, and brother Luke. She creates a family tree, that you see below. </p>

  <p>Now she wants to make this tree interactive. First, she wants the program to be able to determine the relationship between her and a random relative. For this, the program can use the information about the relative's parents (compare two people's parents), and if that person is male or female.</p> 
  <p>How many if-else expressions will she need to use to find out the relationship between Annie and her random relative?</p>
